// What is obsolescene?
// What is planned obsolescence?	
// What is perceived obsolescence?	
// What is an electronic input?

//  An electronic input device is something that sends an electronic signal into a device.	
// Perceived obsolescence is when people believe a product is obsolete. 
// This can be due to advertising, fashions or trends. 	
// Planned obsolescence is when a manufacture deliberately designs a product to stop working after a set time, even though it could be designed to work for longer.

// What are examples of electronic outputs?	
// What is an electric circuit?	
// What is an electrical conductor? 

//  An electrical conductor is a material that electricity can flow through. 	
// -An electronic circuit is made up of electronic components connected together. 
//  -For a circuit to work, the load (the component that uses energy) and energy source (battery) must form a ‘closed’ loop. 	
// Lights, speakers and motors are examples of electronic outputs. 	
// Output devices in electronic systems transform electrical energy into another type of energy, such as light, sound or kinetic energy (movement).	
// Switches, buttons and microphones are examples of electronic inputs.

// What two things does a battery do in a circuit?	
// In a circuit, what is a load?	
// What do resistors do?	
// How can you tell the value (resistance) of a resistor?

// The coloured bands on a resister indicate its resistance. 
// They can be used to calculate the value of the resistor. 	
// Resistors are electronic components that restrict the flow of current around a circuit. 	
// The component in a circuit that uses energy, such as an LED, buzzer or motor.
//  A battery forces electrons around a circuit and gives electrons energy, which they can transfer to a load in the circuit. 
// 	An electrical insulator is a material that electricity cannot flow through.

// How do you fix components to a PCB?	
// What are the safety precautions you should take when soldering (list 4)?	
// How are polymers produced?	
//  What is the difference between a renewable and non-renewable material?

//  -Non-renewable material will eventually run out. 
//  -Renewable materials can be replaced. 	
// -Crude oil is made up of a mixture of lots of different hydrocarbons. 
//  -Fractional distillation is used to separate the out.  
//  -Naphtha is used to produce monomers. 
//  -Monomers are joined together to produce polymers. 	
// -Always wear goggles. 
//  -Use a stand to hold the PCB.
//  -Only one person uses the soldering iron.
//  -Put the soldering iron in the stand 
//  whenever it is not being used.  	Components are fixed to a PCB using solder. 	Ohms (Ω)

// What are the 6 Rs?

//  -Rethink 
//  -Reuse
//  -Recycle 
//  -Repair 
//  -Reduce 
//  -Refuse	Sustainability means meeting the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. 	Crosslinks form when plastic is shaped for the first time. 
 
//  i. Can only be formed once. 
//  ii. Can withstand higher 
//  temperature
//  iii. Used in electrical and 
//  cooking items	No crosslinks = can be melted and shaped many times 
 
//  i.  Can be recycled  
//  ii. Has a lower melting than thermosetting plastics. 
//  iii. Most plastic items are made using thermoplastics. 	-Non-renewable material include metals and plastics. 
//  -Renewable materials include timber and cotton.
